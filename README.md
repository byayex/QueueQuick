# QueueQuick - Repo

Welcome to the QueueQuick repository! QueueQuick is a SaaS project aimed at providing entrepreneurs with the ability to create waitlists not just for email, but for multiple other channels like WhatsApp and more.

## Project Background

QueueQuick started as a side hustle with the vision of offering versatile waitlist solutions to entrepreneurs. Although the project is nearly finished, I decided to shift my focus to other business ideas. Therefore, I've made this project public for anyone who might find it useful or wants to continue its development.

## Getting Started

### Backend

#### Development
```bash

This will build an executable for production use.

#### Frontend

To start the frontend, use the following commands:
